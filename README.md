# Urban-Planning

Designers plan a graph with edges and vertices connected in a grid pattern.

The vertices exist at each intersection. Also, vertices and edges have specific weights.

There are exactly n*n vertices. By default, n = 5.

The variable vDist(i) stores The weight of each vertex.

Also,  the variable eDist(i) stores the weight of each edge.

The planners can denote its source in any of the lots, L1 to Ln,

which are adjacent to the vertices in the first column.

On the other side of the graph are their n targets, R1 to Rn.

The planners would like to denote their sources to allow for paths to targets with minimum weights.

The goal is to determine the locations of their sources,
and the best routes to targets.
